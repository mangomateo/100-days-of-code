# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: Wed 09-09-2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed styling on my date calculator project. Also did some DOM manipulation to show dates on the page. 

**Thoughts** Haven't written any code in a few days, so it's nice to get back on the horse!

### Day 2: Wed 09-05-2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of today working on the design of the date calculator. Got reacquainted with DOM manipulation and CSS grid.  

**Thoughts** Realized today that it has been awhile since I'd written any CSS or HTML. It was a good day of practice, and also my first time using CSS Grid in any meaningful way.

### Day 1: Wed 09-04-2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a date calculator app that will help quickly identify expiry dates for food products where I work (Starbucks).

**Thoughts** Today is day 1 of 100. I feel so great to be working on actual projects instead of doing tutorial after tutorial getting no results. I'm excited to see where I end up in 100 days!
