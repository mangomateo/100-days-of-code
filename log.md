# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Wed 09-04-2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a date calculator app that will help quickly identify expiry dates for food products where I work (Starbucks).

**Thoughts** Today is day 1 of 100. I feel so great to be working on actual projects instead of doing tutorial after tutorial getting no results. I'm excited to see where I end up in 100 days!
